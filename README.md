Perceptron-based AI that learns to play Flappy Bird.

You can watch how this AI performs in my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/HQYsjk9Ufkw).

You can read about this project in my [blog post](https://steemit.com/steemstem/@neavvy/ai-learns-to-play-flappy-bird-the-impact-of-machine-learning-on-steem-blockchain).

You can read a [machine learning tutorial](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@neavvy/teaching-ai-to-play-flappy-bird-the-concept-of-perceptron-or-neural-networks-1) with examples from this project.

**Note:** this application is intended for an Android device with the 1920x1080 screen resolution.
